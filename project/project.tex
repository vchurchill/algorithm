%% NYU PhD thesis format. Created by José Koiller 2007--2008.

%% line for the final version.

\documentclass[12pt,letterpaper]{report}

\newcommand{\thesistitle}{Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis}
\newcommand{\thesisauthor}{Jane Doe}
\newcommand{\thesisadvisor}{Professor Fulana de Tal}

%% If you do not want a dedication, scroll down and comment out

\newcommand{\thesisdedication}{To my dog Weierstra\ss, with affection.}

%% The following makes chapters and sections, but not subsections,
%% appear in the TOC (table of contents). Increase to 2 or 3 to
%% make subsections or subsubsections appear, respectively. It seems
%% to be usual to use the "1" setting, however.
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}

%% Sectional units up to subsubsections are numbered. To number
%% subsections, but not subsubsections, decrease this counter to 2.
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}

%% Page layout (customized to letter paper and NYU requirements):
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{.6in}
\setlength{\textwidth}{5.8in}
\setlength{\topmargin}{.1in}
\setlength{\headheight}{0in}
\setlength{\headsep}{0in}
\setlength{\textheight}{8.3in}
\setlength{\footskip}{.5in}

%% Use the following commands, if desired, during production.
%% Comment them out for final version.
%\usepackage{layout} % defines the \layout command, see below
%\setlength{\hoffset}{-.75in} % creates a large right margin for notes and \showlabels

%% Controls spacing between lines (\doublespacing, \onehalfspacing, etc.):
\usepackage{setspace}

%% Use the line below for official NYU version, which requires
%% double line spacing. For all other uses, this is unnecessary,
%% so the line can be commented out.
\doublespacing % requires package setspace, invoked above

%% Each of the following lines defines the \com command, which produces
%% a comment (notes for yourself, for instance) in the output file.
%% Example:    \com{this will appear as a comment in the output}
%% Choose (uncomment) only one of the three forms:
%\newcommand{\com}[1]{[/// {#1} ///]}       % between [/// and ///].
\newcommand{\com}[1]{\marginpar{\tiny #1}} % as (tiny) margin notes
%\newcommand{\com}[1]{}                     % suppress all comments.

%% This inputs your auxiliary file with \usepackage's and \newcommand's:
%% It is assumed that that file is called "definitions.tex".
\input{definitions}

%% Cross-referencing utilities. Use one or the other--whichever you prefer--
%% but comment out both lines for final version.
%\usepackage{showlabels}
%\usepackage{showkeys}

%% Introduction. If your thesis has no introduction, or chapter 1 is

%% If your thesis has different "Parts", use commands such as the following:

\section{Statement of problem\label{chap:one}}

Suppose we are solving the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation in three dimensions on a surface of revolution such that:
\begin{align}
\Delta{u} &= 0 & \mbox{in }\Omega\\
u &= f & \mbox{on }\Gamma\\
u &\rightarrow 0 & \mbox{as } \mathbf{x}\rightarrow\infty
\end{align}

The original kernel-independent fast multipole method 

\begin{center}
M2L: $\int_{\mathbf{y}^{B,d}}{G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\phi^{B,d}{(\mathbf{y})}d\mathbf{y}$ = $\int_{\mathbf{y}^{A,u}}{G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\phi^{A,u}{(\mathbf{y})}d\mathbf{y}$ for all $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{x}^{B,d}$
\end{center}

\section{The Riemann Hypothesis\label{sec:hypothesis}}

Blah, blah, blah. There is nothing interesting in
figure~\ref{fig:afigure}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \emph{This statement is false.}
  \end{center}%
\caption[This alternate caption appears in the list of figures.]{This is the
caption that appears under the figure. It may be quite long---you wouldn't want
such a long caption to appear in the ``list of figures''.}
\label{fig:afigure}
\end{figure}

More blah, blah. There is nothing interesting about
table~\ref{tab:atable} either.
\begin{table}[htb]
\caption[Strange rules.]{For some reason unfamiliar to me,
typesetting rules require one to place captions above tables,
but below figures. Go figure.}\label{tab:atable}
  \begin{center}
    \framebox{You could put a table here. I won't.}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Another section\label{sec:two}}

Notice that the fist paragraph is indented. There's a package
to do that automatically. Blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

%% Note: If your thesis has more than one appendix, NYU requires a "list of
%% appendices" page before the body of the thesis. I don't provide the tools
%% to create that here, so you're on your own for that one... Sorry.
